We’re gonna introduce a narrator. eating an apple will make the narrator proceed to the next line.

Narrator lines come with what they will say and then in between parenthesis the change in game mechanics prompted by then. 

Please implement each of them one by one. Feel free to increase the total number of apples in the game. notice that the end of the game is another now, 

Oh, hello there!

This is your Lovi Lovi here

You know, our relationship is one of the most beautiful things in my life

That’s why I sing (make sure you can listen to me!)
(start playing lovi-lovi-song.m4a)

I know, I know, it’s not all smooth sailing

Sometimes it's confusing
(stop song)
(Revert controls)

But suddenly you get used to the quirks of the other, and it feels all natural again...
(Controls back to normal)

Except..

Could we walk faster?
(Increase speed by 2x)

Could we walk slowlier?
(Reduce speed by 2x)

Until we meet on the middle
(Go back to normal)

Or not…
(Change speed every second)

But with little acts we show our love
(Replace 🍎 with ☕)

Crisis might occur
(Shake the screen)

And we need to think outside of the box
(Find apple by going through the wall, pause horse movement, and create an animation)

And we see the beauty in all of it!
(Add little flowers around the screen)

You've been so patient with this silly game...
(Zoom out, show around the green background as black)

Just like you're patient with me every day...
(Zoom out again)

And I know it took me very very long… 

I just wanted it written in the stars
(Continue zoom out, until everything is black, and there's just a white dot)
(Wait 5 seconds)
(Turn screen to black fully, redirect to https://eduucaldas.github.io/pov/)
