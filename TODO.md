# Project spec for "horses"

## Objective
Surprise my girlfriend with a marriage proposal.

### Context about the project
I promised I would propose in the presence of a horse. However my girlfriend is vegan and the only consensual horse is the one made of bits.

### Context about me
I'm a software engineer at Google, don't shy away about explaining stuff technically. Although I have experience with Web dev I use internal frameworks to Google.

### Idea
Create a publicly available website with a little (easy) game, where the main theme is 'horses". And when she beats the game a ring appears.
The horses game could be a mimic of "snake" but with a horse. And whenever the horse eats apples there's a new horse that appears.

## How
1. First let's plan, don't implement anything, let's clarify the scope and create step-by-step plan. I first milestone could be some static web page with "hello world"
2. Ask me clarifying questions whenever you're not sure.
3. Write tests! The tests should be readable, behaviour-driven and should be fast. For testing my preferred stack is Jasmine with Karma.
4. Let's choose our dependencies carefully, trying to minimize the amount of dependencies.
5. When choosing a framework, prioritize simplicity, this is a throwaway project.
6. Avoid financial costs, I don't want to pay hosting for this.


## Technology used
1. VCS: jj with git backend.
2. Typescript, HTML, Tailwind CSS.
3. Keep asking
